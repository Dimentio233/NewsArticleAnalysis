Readme:

To run our program, you need to pip install requests, nltk, bs4, textblob, newspaper3k,newspaper, and wordcloud.

After these packages, you can run news_scrape.py to build a CSV file that contains scraped content of 66
news articles from CNN and Fox News.

To reproduce the word cloud, run make_wordcloud.py which will generate png images of two word clouds.

Then, run analysis.py to train our machine learning model, view results of model accuracy and our statistical analysis.

Thanks for reading! We hope you like the project!
